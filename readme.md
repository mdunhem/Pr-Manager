Press Release Manager
=======

WordPress Uploader Plugin.

Description
-----------------------------------

Allows uploading of articles or press releases in PDF format to the blog seperately from the Wordpress built-in media uploader. Allows for a short description of what the article is and the date it was written. The information is then stored into the database for easy use on seperate pages that need access to these articles (e.g. a press release page with all press releases stored on one page.) Used as a content management application.
Uses [jQuery-File-Upload](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/) as the upload framework
